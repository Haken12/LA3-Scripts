# LA3-Scripts
Converted files from the original LA3 text files.  

Scripts have been converted into a new format that is easy to use with a set of tools.
They are located in new-format/2B-forEdit 
If you are working on a file, please MOVE it to the in-progress folder, and then make edits there.

raw scripts are located: unpackedrom/data/usr2/eventdata  
You need an editor that supports the Shift-JIS encoding, so I recommend notepad++
