# LA3-Scripts
Converted files from the original LA3 text files.  
Import the data into excel as a table in order to edit the files easily  
Scripts split using https://github.com/micah686/LA3-Splitter  

Some of the old translated files couldn't be converted easily, so I added them into the folder at the top  
You can get the raw undedited scripts from an unpacked rom  
If anyone feels free, go ahead and transfer the partially translated text over to the new xml format  

raw scripts are located: unpackedrom/data/usr2/eventdata  
You need an editor that supports the Shift-JIS encoding, so I recommend notepad++
