favorite tool?$e3
~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0012----
Um.# that's an important tool, but it's
not that compatible with me.

~---------------------------------------
Rephy
----0013----
Certainly.#, just like weapons they can
differ from a person to another.

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0014----
Some are easier to give you affection.

~---------------------------------------
Rephy
----0015----
But which one was anyway?

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0016----
This one.

~---------------------------------------
Rephy
----0017----

Rephy
----0025----
Heh, that's amazing. It's like a weapon
you're used to.

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0026----
Fighting and cleaning are different.

~---------------------------------------
Rephy
----0027----

Wrong guess. But if it's you, you can
be anything you want.

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0040----

~---------------------------------------
Rephy
----0041----
You can tell just by watching your
everyday life.

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0042----
So you have been watching me.#

~---------------------------------------
Rephy

hard for my dream.

~---------------------------------------
Shion
----0045----
Y-Yes, that's right！

You were enjoying yourself back at the
festival.

~---------------------------------------
Shion

Shion
----0052----
I'm not made for it, after all.#?
