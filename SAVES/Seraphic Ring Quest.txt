After the final battle of Chapter 14, the Rephy will be left
in the Teleport Chamber with Sara, in the top most corner
of the room there is a shinning spot, go check it and Rephy
will discover an item, after a conversation with Sara they
will go to the Workshops and talk with the Sisters and Yuu(AKA Rick).
The item seems to contain some of the Millia's power but it's broken
and loosing magic, the sisters say they can repair with if you can
get some [Millia Stone] from a monster called [Buccaboo] in the
Sandal Forest. To continue the quest you must talk to the Sisters
in the workshop(beware: there's no prompt or event icon to indicate
this event). Before the free time in chapter 20, Yuu will come to
tell Rephy that the ring had been repaired. After that you must
talk to Elle in the Bath(no "!" mark) to continue. After that an
event will occur and the ring will disappear(went back to Millia).
