After the final battle of Chapter 14, the Rephy will be left
in the Teleport Chamber with Sara, in the top most corner
of the room there is a shinning spot, go check it and Rephy
will discover an item, after a conversation with Sara they
will go to the Workshops and talk with the Sisters and Yuu(AKA Rick).
The item seems to contain some of the Millia's power but it's broken
and loosing magic, the sisters say they can repair with if you can
get some [Millia Stone] from a moster called [Buccaboo] in the
Sandal Forest. To continue the quest you must talk to the Sisters
in the workshpo(beware: there's no prompt or event icon to indicate
this event).
